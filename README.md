# openverify
OpenVerify is, collectively, a few PHP scripts that can be used for verifying legitimate installations of PHP SaaS.

## Info
In the source code are two demo PHP pages. index.php is to be bundled with your SaaS application, and verify.php is to be on a server. Both files have documentation built in that you can follow to setup your app.

## Programmer's Note
Yes, I can see the irony in creating an open source tool designed for paid, closed-source apps, but while programming another project, I realized there was no real solution for PHP apps. So, to make things easier for people like me who still like PHP, I made it open-source.
